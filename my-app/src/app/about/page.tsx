          Hi, I'm Arthur GUERINAULT a French student in IT at Epitech Bordeaux. I've been coding for two years now. I started in high school with NSI, a specialty focused on learning computer science.

        I've done an internship in a startup called "Yalink" 
        which helps freelancers in building engineering. I learned TypeScript, Next.js, and Nhost at Yalink, it was an incredible experience.<br/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this year, I've been acting as a mentor for new students. For my fourth year at Epitech, I want to go to a cold country like Canada or Finland.
      </p>
      <p>The things I love in life are snowboarding, going out with friends and going to concerts.</p>
      <p>I wish to work as a freelancer in the future or remotely because I chose this field to have the freedom to work wherever I want.</p>
